As a frontend developer, I am dedicated to crafting seamless user experiences through clean code, semantic design, and scalable architectures. A quick learner and advocate for open-source, I continuously explore Generative AI, tackle complex challenges like WebSocket implementations, and lead innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology. Driven by curiosity and the question, &ldquo;Why not better?&rdquo;, I strive to create meaningful solutions while fostering collaboration and long-term relationships.
